## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development.

Get it now if it's not already installed on your machine.

**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.

## Install npm packages

> See npm and nvm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```
